        <p>I was born on a cold winter morning, on the twenty-sixth day of December, in the year eighteen-thousand and seven since the coming of our Lord. My parents named me after my father, Robert, who was a dual butcher and farmer in Gloucester. My mother was Sarah Oakey.</p>
        <p>As a boy I helped my father in his shoppe. He taught me how to know which cows had the best meats, and how to separate, clean, and prepare the cuts. We had a happy life, though we worked hard, living among the fields and hamlets in the area known as Gloucester.</p>

        <p>I often go to play with the other boys in the streets. We've become fond of the new sport of pugilism - that is, to fight honorably in a ring with one’s fists. Except, we haven't got no ring. Just us boys gettin' dirty and scratched and scolded by our mums. I am the strongest of all! There is none that can fell me!</p>
        <p>My sister, Elizabeth, who is younger than I, often comes with me to fight. She encourages me, yellin' from the crowds.</p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hannah, the woman I love, has accepted my hand in marriage! Here follow the curious circumstances of our union:</p>
        <p>As both Hannah and I feel partial toward the Methodist movement, we petitioned a minister of that congregation to perform the rites early this spring. We passed a happy summer together, until word began to spread of our marriage. Many of the older generation turned hostile toward us, for English law only considers marriage to be legal if performed by the Church of England.</p>
        <p>As such, to appease the law and the land, we posted our banns in the church and have been married again, by the Church of England, this September, in the Parish of St Mary de Lode. Elizabeth and Daniel acted as witnesses to the event.</p>
        <p>All this commotion has raised several questions in my mind. Why should there be churches thus, which war with each other over authority. Is there any one church that can claim the proper authority to perform a marriage?</p>
